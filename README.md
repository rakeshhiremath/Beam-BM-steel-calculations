# Beam-BM-steel-calculations
Bending moment of beam is analysed for steel and consequently steel is calculated by Splitting beam in 3 parts and 3 layers.

1. "Support and span" is the trial file for the calculations and doesnt involve lower support iterations.

2. "Coffer Beam(Complete and final)" is the sheet that does the analysis for a doubly reinforced fixed support beam and does Area of Steel required by plotting the Ast Required and Ast Provided. Gives clear understanding  of how the safety is ensured.

3. "For different behaviour of beams" does the calculations for the same taking into consideration the differnt behaviour of beams such as a cantilever, Proped Cantilever, Simply Supported, Butterfly effect etc.
